# Example React Store

This is just a small and (incomplete here) example of a simple store for react that can be used to globally manage states, in a very simple way - that separates out concerns, with a very small footprint, in a clear way, that requires no additional mapping, other than the handling of how the updated state should be used in the component.

As stated, this example won't run as-is, and hasn't be linted or checked. Its just a proof of concept, based roughly on a larger project that is implementing this methodology, and is here for discussion about what is missing etc.
